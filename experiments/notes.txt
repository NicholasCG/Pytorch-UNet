Glare iamge 1:
The added weight technique seems to work best to create a natural image. 
Notable issues are that is doesn't create a concentrated region of brightness, but rather an expanding blob.
There is also the issue that it brightens the entire screen.

Glare image 2:
Added weight techniques overly brightens the image, do not use this technique.
The transparency layering technique seems to have some promise. The rays are concerning, 
but something that can possible be kept in. Maybe don't do the resizing operation?

Glare image 3:
Same with glare image 2, except the two small dots are annoying -_-.
The rays are extra big on this one, which may cause training issues later.

For glare 2 and 3, using warp affine produces images of better quality in my opinion, even better than with added
weight tehcnique with glare image 1. Will create a training set using all three images, and try to get in contact
with Miche to get her opinion.

Glare image 4:
Add weight technique only excessively brightens the image, does not actually create a good spot of sunglare.
For transparency layering technique, the resizing operation leads to a sizing issue. The sun glare is too big and does
not lead to a natural looking image. Do not use this sun glare.
